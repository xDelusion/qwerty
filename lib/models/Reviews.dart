            'Simply House is the best medical series made or will be! If you happen to read my previous reviews, you will know that I do not like long interviews, in short, House is the best medical series that is integrated in all of its 176 episodes . My rate : 9.7'),

            'Hugh Laurie master of being head doctor, jerk, sophisticated, and quirky! This show is so enjoyable it gives me goosebumps often. House M.D. is so well done very much deserves the 2 Emmys earned. Filled with complex circumstances that are bumpy with many accurate or mishaps but more wins than not throughout. The characters go through a lot which is intriguing and always entertaining! Even the simple patients are always worth seeing. I love the show and all interesting facts around it!'),

            "While most of my fellow Americans have never heard of him before I have been a fan of Hugh Laurie since I first saw him in Black Adder back in the 1980's (Thank goodness my local PBS station showed British shows back then). \n"
            "When I first saw Hugh in House, M.D, I couldn't believe this is the same person who played silly Prince George and Lt George. Here he is playing a serious character without his British accent! I had to check the name in the credits to make sure it was him.\n"
            "I hope the American public recognizes what a great actor he is.\n"
            "If you like him in House, MD, watch him in the Black Adder series."),
