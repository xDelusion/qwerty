Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps), Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) are the three original underlings. Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) is his only true friend. Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) starts as his boss.\n"

He is inevitably the smartest man in the room. Oh did I mention that he's a drug addict. It's master acting class from Hugh. It's physical. It's accent work. It's character work. It's a great character."

Super bad decisions that get made over and over again by everyone. By the end of season 3 this show is becoming near unwatchable. Usually i stay the course with shows I begin, but this one will be ending for me if it gets much worse.",
          "Seasons 1-4 were phenomenal. Seasons 5-6 weren't as good, but still really solid seasons with some fantastic episodes. Season 7 started out great with its first two episodes & a few other gems, but for the most part was downright horrendous.\n"
              "The 100's final season ruined the entire show arguably more than Game of Thrones' 8th season did for itself. It's as though everything that made The 100 what it was for the first 6 seasons got thrown out of the window in favor of spiteful, terrible writing. What was once my favorite show has no rewatchability after Season 7."

It's an action packed thriller that keeps you entertained throughout the entire series and one of the better martial arts series I've ever seen! The fight scenes are the biggest highlight of the show though, the choreography is just beautiful."

In fact it's getting better. OK, so perhaps they're beginning to 'pair up' the six of them, but so what. Chandler's sarcasm is still as funny as ever. Monica's quirkiness still works. Phoebe's goofiness still brings about a smile. And Joey,Rachel and Ross are still as funny as they always were. So stop being a bunch of cynics and enjoy the show while it's still on.",

Being born and raised in Manhattan, I loved that it took place in my city. Even though I was not raised in affluence, The series made me imagine that I did. The acting was so superbly done by everyone, especially Ed Westwick and Leighton Bleester. Their chemistry was so intense and real, it seemed amazing they didn't get together in real life. I'm so sorry that it's over, but happy that I can play it over again whenever I want. I think that we will be seeing a lot more of Ed Westwick in the future; he is an amazing talent."
